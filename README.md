# Full Stack Web Development Journey 💻🌐

Welcome to my Full Stack Web Development learning repository! This space documents my continuous journey of learning and building in the world of web development — one day at a time.

## 🚀 About This Repository

This is a personal initiative to master full stack development by studying, coding, and building projects daily. Every commit reflects real progress — from basic concepts to advanced tools and techniques across the stack.

Whether you're a fellow learner or just exploring, feel free to browse, fork, or contribute.

## 🎯 Goals

* **Frontend Mastery:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and UI/UX best practices.
* **Backend Skills:** Python (Flask/Django), Node.js, Express, and secure backend logic.
* **Database Knowledge:** SQL, NoSQL (MongoDB), and ORMs like SQLAlchemy or Mongoose.
* **API Development:** Build and consume RESTful and GraphQL APIs.
* **Deployment Proficiency:** Deploy full stack applications using Render, Netlify, Vercel, Railway, etc.
* **Version Control:** Efficient use of Git and GitHub.
* **Project Portfolio:** Create functional, real-world applications suitable for showcasing.

## 📜 Guiding Principles

1. Learn and code **every day** — minimum of 2 hours.
2. Commit daily to reflect real progress.
3. Maintain clean documentation and folder structure.
4. Focus on real-world problems and full-stack implementation.
5. Continuously refactor and improve older code.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each day or module is organized as:

* `DayXX/` folders (e.g., `Day01`, `Day02`) or topic-based folders:

  * `code/` – Source code for that session's learning or mini-project.
  * `notes.md` – Concepts, insights, and references.
  * `resources/` – Useful links, articles, and docs.

Major standalone projects will reside in a separate `/projects` directory.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5
* **Backend:** 
* **Database:** 
* **Dev Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code
* **Deployment:** 
* **Concepts:** 

## 📓 Progress Log (Sample)
