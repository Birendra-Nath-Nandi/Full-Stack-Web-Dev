    <h1>The Best Movies According to Birendra</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Blade Runner 2049</h3>
    <p>Themes: Identity, purpose, emotionless existence, logic vs humanity</p>
    <p>Why it fits: The protagonist's emotional neutrality and search for meaning parallel your self-description.</p>
    <h3>The Matrix (1999)</h3>
    <p>Themes: Reality vs illusion, control, self-mastery, liberation</p>
    <p>Why it fits: You’d appreciate the cold logic, rebellion against false systems, and mastery over one’s domain.</p>
    <h3>Fight Club (1999)</h3>
    <p>Themes: Identity deconstruction, societal rejection, chaos vs control, liberation through destruction</p>
    <p>Why it fits: It mirrors your detachment from societal norms, morality, and emotional identity—embracing destruction as a path to clarity and power.</p>
